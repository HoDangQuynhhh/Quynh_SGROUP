        <p>
            You probably build websites using vim and you think that's hardcore. You think your 4.99KB 
            <span class="brown-text">motherfuckingwebsite</span>
            (.com) is going to get you some award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
        </p>
        <p>Well, guess what, you're 
            <u class="doTham-text">WRONG</u>
            , motherfucker.
        </p>
        <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
        <p>Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past 
            <span class="doTham-text small-test">motherfuckingwebsites</span>
            :
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
            <li>
                The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the 
                <a href = "https://www.google.com/" class="ca1a70-test">Google home page</a>
            </li>
            <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your 16x32 Tamagotchi, I'm sorry)</li>
            <li>Looks almost the same on every screen</li>
            <li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem 
                <span class="small_test">well, kind of</span>
            </li>
            <li>It's 
                <a href = "https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" class="ca1a70-test">accessible</a>
                , so everyone can enjoy it 
                <span class="small_test">but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</span>
            </li>
            <li>Shit is even more legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an 
                <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" class="ca1a70-test">ARPANET</a>
                website
            </li>
            <li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use 
                <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers" class="blue-test">IPoAC</a>
            </li>
            <li>Uses only free and open-source resources, like this awesome font called "Open Sans" which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</li>
            <li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is proudly made with plain HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
            <li>Doesn't include any tracking service</li>
            <li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available JUST USE IT.</li>
            <li>Use some fucking 
                <span class="bd-test">colors</span>
                .
            </li>
            <li>Links don't really need to keep that 
                <span class="shitty-blue-test">shitty blue</span> 
                the browser is giving them: nor that 
                <span class="violetish-test">violetish color</span> 
                when they are marked as visited. Just give them a

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
        <p>This website is even better than the last     
            <a href = "http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/" class="ca1a70-test">guy</a>
            and the

            .
        </p>
        <p>Why?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>It's over a 
                <span class="bd-test">secure connection</span> 
                - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).
            </li>
            <li>It uses one of the most general 
                <span class="bd-test">gTLDs</span>  
                available out there: .website
            </li>
            <li>It uses the TLD, too: thebestmotherfucking.website, check out 
                <span class="bd-test">domainr</span>  
                to do something cool too.
            </li>
            <li>It uses the kickass 
                <span class="bd-test">Let's Encrypt CA</span>  
                (don't you see the gorgeous lock?)
            </li>
            <li>It uses 
                <span class="bd-test">a custom </span>
                version of the awesome

                <b>/s</b>
            </li>
            <li>It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is outdated they will notice and maybe they will switch from 
                <span class="bd-test">the crap they use</span> 
                to a much cooler browser
            </li>
            <li>It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript

                </li>
            <li>Freaks who are scared of JavaScript will feel safe here since the website doesn't need to have JS enable to be properly rendered</li>
            <li>It supports 
                <span class="bd-test">HTTP/2</span>
            </li>
            <li>It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the website more than once</li>

                , making it 
                <span class="bd-test">almost free</span>
                to keep this website alive

        <p>Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make a text that is only readable by ants.</p>

Oh and by the way, this doesn't mean that you should use webpack and put everything in a 10MB main.js file, there are people out there who are still using 56k modems and haven't tried

            , so go check 'em out. Nevertheless, this shows that the internet has taken a really wrong turn - I honestly miss the time when websites were made to convey information. At least, thanks god, we got rid of pop-ups.
